# GoLocal

GoLocal is a mobile application made entirely in Swift. Its main functionality is viewing events and voting in event polls.

## Description

GoLocal is a mobile application that unifies all types of events in one place. It allows users to create and participate in event-related polls, such as selecting the best date or assessing attendance. Through interactive voting and map integration, GoLocal makes event discovery easier and helps organizers tailor events to participants' preferences. More description (in Polish) in [Word specifications](docs/iOS%20-%20labs%20aplikacja%20Mikołaj%20Kubś%20grupa%20wt%207;30%20.docx).

## Features implemented

- Ability to create events and votings (polls related to events)
- User voting on different event aspects
- User registration and login (kinda mocked)
- Event display on a map with location integration
- Event display in a searchable and filterable list
- Votings display in a searchable and filterable list
- Sending notifications to users (also kind of mocked)
- Polish and English language support
- Integration with Apple Maps and GPS (path to event)
- High contrast UI for better readability outdoors
- Fast loading times and smooth and native animations
- Event photo gallery
- Dark and Light UI mode
- Ability for users to change their password, email etc.

## Context

This was an application created for a "Developing Mobile Applications for IOS Platform" PWr course. Because of my very limited access to a Mac (I practically had access to one during laboratories in University), this project's quality was limited. If I had better access to something I could create an iOS application in, I would do some things different. For example use protocols to allow in the future to replace mocked services with real ones or even implement these services.
